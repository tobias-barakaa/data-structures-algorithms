In this repository we are going to learn more about DATA-STRUCTURES and Algorithms


Array

A collection of similar data elements

Structure

A collection of data member that are realted under one name

complex number

a + i b

Pointers

1: why pointers
2: Declaration
3: initialisation
4: Deferencing
5: Dynamic Allocation

Def:

Pointer is an address variable that is mearnt for storing addreses and accesing key data in the memory
accesing the resources which are outside the program

CPU = memory -> code section |
      stack                  | section of memory
      Heap

malloc and pointers work hand in hand for example;
to save memory in C we use malloc function while in CPP
we use New

Functions
a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task or a set of related tasks. 
monolithic= more functions in one main 
more functions is called modular/procedural programming
